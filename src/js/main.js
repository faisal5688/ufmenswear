UPDATE: This is absolutely horrible, I have a new respect for the workings of
        javascript!! Althought, it is one of my favorite languages..

        I suggest you view in a full window becuase i have not yet made images
        responsive enough, so the images just look fat and stretchy.

UPDATE: Used an image compressor @http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/ as well used
        an html formatter @http://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html.
        Since load time was INSANE, i improved by getting rid of my CSS only image
        pre-loader, compressing images, and uplaoded all images to google's image
        hosting, SAME domain.
        Made an image sprite for the buttons and logo.
